        Responsible person in terms of data protection laws, in particular the EU General Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO), is:
        Anne Eberhard
        
        <h4>Your data subject rights</h4>
        You can exercise the following rights at any time using the contact details provided for our data protection officer:
        - Information about your data stored by us and its processing (Art. 15 DSGVO),
        - Correction of incorrect personal data (Art. 16 DSGVO),
        - Deletion of your data stored by us (Art. 17 DSGVO),
        - Restriction of data processing if we are not yet allowed to delete your data due to legal obligations (Art. 18 DSGVO),
        - objection to the processing of your data by us (Art. 21 DSGVO) and
        - Data portability, provided that you have consented to the data processing or have concluded a contract with us (Art. 20 DSGVO).
        
        If you have given us consent, you can revoke this at any time with effect for the future.
        You may at any time lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, e.g. the competent supervisory authority in the federal state of your residence or the authority responsible for us as the responsible body.
        A list of supervisory authorities (for the non-public sector) with address can be found at: https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Service/Anschriften/Laender/Laender-node.html
        
       <h4>Collection of general information when visiting our website</h4> 
        <h4>Nature and purpose of processing:</h4>
        When you access our website, i.e., when you do not register or otherwise submit information, information of a general nature is automatically collected. This information (server log files) includes, for example, the type of web browser, the operating system used, the domain name of your Internet service provider, your IP address and the like.
        In particular, they are processed for the following purposes:
        - Ensuring a smooth connection setup of the website,
        - Ensuring a smooth use of our website,
        - evaluating system security and stability, and
        - to optimize our website.
        We do not use your data to draw conclusions about your person. Information of this kind will be statistically evaluated anonymously by us, if necessary, in order to optimize our Internet presence and the technology behind it.
        <h4>Legal basis and legitimate interest:</h4>
        The processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 (1) lit. f DSGVO on the basis of our legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of our website.
        <h4>Recipients:</h4>
        Recipients of the data may be technical service providers who act as order processors for the operation and maintenance of our website.
       <h4>Storage period:</h4> 
        The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. This is generally the case for data used to provide the website when the respective session has ended.
        Provision prescribed or required:
        The provision of the aforementioned personal data is not required by law or contract. However, without the IP address, the service and functionality of our website is not guaranteed. In addition, individual services and services may not be available or may be limited. For this reason, an objection is excluded.
<h4>Use of script libraries (Google Web Fonts)</h4> 
        In order to display our content correctly and graphically appealing across browsers, we use "Google Web Fonts" from Google LLC (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; hereinafter "Google") on this website to display fonts.
        You can find more information about Google Web Fonts at
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq">https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq</a> and
         
        <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a>
        <h4>Use of Typekit web fonts from Adobe Fonts</h4>
        We use Typekit web fonts from Adobe Fonts for the visual design of our website. Adobe Fonts is a service provided by Adobe Systems Software Ireland Companies (4-6 Riverwalk, Citywest Business Campus, Dublin 24, Republic of Ireland; hereinafter "Adobe"), which gives us access to a font library.
        In order to integrate the fonts we use, your browser must establish a connection to an Adobe server in the USA and download the font required for our website. Adobe thereby receives the information that our website was accessed from your IP address.
        You can find more information about Adobe Fonts in the Adobe Fonts privacy policy, which you can access here: https://www.adobe.com/de/privacy/policies/adobe-fonts.html.
        If your browser does not support web fonts, or you do not give your consent, a default font will be used by your computer.
       <h4>Withdrawal of consent:</h4> 
        No option for a simple opt-out or blocking of data transmission is currently offered by the provider. If you wish to prevent tracking of your activities on our website, please revoke your consent for the corresponding cookie category or all technically unnecessary cookies and data transfers in the cookie consent tool. In this case, however, you may not be able to use our website or may only be able to use it to a limited extent.
       <h4>Revocation of consent:</h4> 
        No option for a simple opt-out or blocking of data transmission is currently offered by the provider. If you wish to prevent tracking of your activities on our website, please revoke your consent for the relevant cookie category or all technically unnecessary cookies and data transfers in the cookie consent tool. In this case, however, you may not be able to use our website or may only be able to use it to a limited extent.
        <h4>SSL encryption</h4>
        To protect the security of your data during transmission, we use state of the art encryption (e.g. SSL) via HTTPS.
        <h4>Information about your right to object according to Art. 21 DSGVO</h4>
        <h4>Individual right of objection</h4>
        You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of personal data relating to you which is carried out on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) DSGVO (data processing on the basis of a balance of interests); this also applies to profiling based on this provision within the meaning of Art. 4 No. 4 DSGVO.
        If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims.
        <h4>Recipients of an objection</h4>
        Anne Eberhard
        <h4>Changes to our privacy policy</h4>
        We reserve the right to adapt this data protection declaration so that it always complies with the current legal requirements or in order to implement changes to our services in the data protection declaration, e.g. when introducing new services. The new data protection statement will then apply to your next visit.
