        <h3>What is Join?</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="join">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
          group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp
          at the <span class="developerAkademie">Developer Akademie</span>.
          <br /><br />
          Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective
          method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
          efficiency (or flow). <span class="join">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to help
          users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual
          interface.
          <br /><br />

          When you log in to <span class="join">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board
          represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In
          Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".

          In <span class="join">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to
          the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the
          required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks
          and they can interact with the tasks on the board.

      <div>
        <h4>Adding Cards</h4>
        <p>
          Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards
          represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate
          list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like
          task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.

        <h4>Moving Cards</h4>

          As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on
          the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.
